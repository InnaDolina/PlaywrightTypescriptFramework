# PlaywrightTypescriptFramework

This is a practice project that I decided to start in order to gain knowledge and experience from a real-like scenario.


## Installation

Have nodejs installed in your computer (version 18+). It is good to have the vscode playwright extension.

```
npm install
```

## How to run
Note: playwright might ask you to install it's dependencies on first run.

```
npx plawright test
```

## Extra tools
Dotenv, prettier, eslint, adblocker (because the ads in the site are super annoying).
